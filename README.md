### Hackathon Repository Requirements

Eventually all the solutions (completed or not) need to reside on Github under the Creative Commons license. During the competition however, your code cannot be public so other participants won't be able to see it.

Therefore we suggest the following:

During the competition your Github repository should be password protected, password should be available for your team members and the judges only. You can use [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) or any other tool / solution for that. The goal is to make sure your code is timestamped and you are not applying with code that was committed & pushed after certain deadline.

Your Github repository should be totally decrypted after Submission Deadline, so other teams can also help verifying correction of your solution as well.

The repository should consist of a description how to run the computation or ideally should run them within one command: `make start`. The whole environment setup should also be described in a README.md file. Judges can ask to add their public SSH keys should to the machine where the computation has been run to make sure about the computation times.
